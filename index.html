<h3>I read code. I write code. I build software.</h3>

<p>
I am a software engineer with more than a decade of combined research and
development experience. I focus on writing code that is robust, simple, and
comprehensible.  I strive to design and build systems that are correct,
maintainable, and perform at scale. I like work that challenges me intellectually, and gives me
an opportunity to keep learning.
</p>

<p>
Notable things I have built:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.newstore.com/">Core components of a modern omnichannel mobile-commerce platform.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816014221/http://code.ohloh.net/">Once, the largest code search engine available online.</a>

</li>
<li>
 <a href="http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/#">One of the earliest academic/research infrastructure for large-scale code search.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

Some of my core strengths:

<ul>
<li>
<i>Software Engineering:</i>
I have a track record of building and delivering software solutions to complex problems.
I have a strong background in Software Engineering research
that helps me succeed as a software engineer.
My current expertise lies in building distributed
microservices to solve complex business problems. I also have expertise in building large scale
search solutions that meet specific information needs. I strive to keep learning and
extend my expertise in other domains.

</li>
<li>
<i>Technical Leadership:</i> I possess collaboration and communication skills to bring
necessary stakeholders on board to get things done. My ability to listen and incorporate
feedback helps me succeed as a technical lead.
</li>
<li>
<i>Quality Work:</i> I am persistent in delivering quality work and fostering it in
my team through reviews, coaching, and continuous feedback.
</li>
<li>
<i>Mentorship:</i> I guide less experienced or new team members to be more effective
and produce high-quality results. I have supervised research projects where
I guided my apprentices in turning ideas into practical solutions.
</li>
<li>
<i>Critical thinking and Attention to Details:</i> With a background in academic
research, I have acquired critical thinking and strong reviewing skills.
These skills make me effective in many software engineering tasks I perform
such as software design, problem decomposition, and writing/reviewing code.
</li>
</ul>
