<h3>I read code. I write code. I build software.</h3>

<p>
I am a software engineer with more than 12 years of combined research and 
development experience. I focus on writing code that is robust, simple, and 
comprehensible.  I strive to design and build systems that are correct, 
maintainable, and perform at scale. I like work that challenges me intellectually, and gives me 
an opportunity to keep learning.
</p>

<p>
Some of my core strengths: 

<ul>
<li>
<i>Domain Expertise:</i>  I have a strong background in Software Engineering research 
that helps me succeed as a software engineer. I have expertise in building 
search solutions and working with big data to make it consumable as valuable 
information to meet user information needs. I strive to keep learning and 
extend my expertise in other domains.
</li>
<li>
<i>Technical Leadership:</i> My ability to work independently, finding solutions 
to hard problems, and disseminating them across the team helps me succeed as 
a technical lead. I possess collaboration and communication skills to bring 
necessary stakeholders on board to get things done. 
</li>
<li>
<i>Quality Work:</i> I am persistent in delivering quality work and fostering it in 
my team through reviews, suggestions, and feedback. 
</li>
<li>
<i>Mentorship:</i> I guide less experienced or new team members to be more effective
and produce high-quality results. I supervise research projects where 
I guide my interns or apprentices in turning ideas into useful solutions.
</li>
<li>
<i>Critical thinking and Attention to Details:</i> With a background in academic 
research, I have acquired critical thinking and strong reviewing skills. 
These skills make me effective in many software engineering tasks I perform 
such as software design, problem decomposition, and writing/reviewing code.
</li>
</ul>
