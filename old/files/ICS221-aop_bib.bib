Importantly, this technique also supports the synthesis of quality-of-service (QoS) management components from particular aspects of the specification. It is described how, by using a tool to support the aspect-oriented environment, one can first specify and verify QoS management subsystems and then synthesise components that can be placed into a running system. The focus is on dynamic QoS management functions, particularly monitoring and adaptation. The approach is illustrated by giving a simple example of the dynamic QoS management of an audio stream.},

However, current component models lack support for important concepts of distributed embedded real-time systems, such as execution time and resource usage. These non-functional properties of a component are as important as its functionality. In addition, the non-functional properties are influenced by the platform on which the component is executed. A component model is proposed that separates the component's functionality from the platform-specific issues of concurrency, synchronisation and distribution. A technique that describes the behaviour of a component in a path-based notation similar to use case maps (UCMs) is presented. A method for deducing from these descriptions the behaviour of an application that consists of connected components is also shown. The paths also contain information on real-time requirements of the application. The authors also show how to adapt the components to an execution platform and how to create real-time applications with predictable properties from these components.},

These two trends have emerged independently from each other, the first one in an industrial setting and the second one originating mostly from the object-oriented languages research community. Despite this independent development, both trends have quite some commonalities: not only do they follow the same goals, the key concepts are also basically the same. However, an effort to put both trends into a common reference frame, showing their commonalities, their differences, drawing boundaries on their application areas, analyzing how they complement each other and eventually profit from each other, etc., is still missing today. This paper is a modest effort to fill this gap.}

During such a composition, mismatches between the data models of different tools will arise. The brute-force technique of hacking data translators into the implementation of individual tools has severe drawbacks regarding the modularity, maintainability and extensibility of the composed system. This paper proposes a novel technique for designing SEEs that uses explicit language constructs for bridging the mismatches in the data models, called dynamic view connectors. It shows how the separation of tool functionality from the concerns of bridging data-model mismatches improves the configurability and maintainability of an existing SEE.},

In this paper, we argue that the simple inheritance rules of existing object-oriented languages are not sufficient for properly dealing with these problems. In the proposal presented in this paper, programmers are enabled to make metalevel declarations of the internal protocols and dependencies of their classes. Additionally, changes of the base module are automatically monitored to filter out information about the alterations that may invalidate already existing inheritors. Based on these informations, the subclassing semantics is adjusted such that the maintenance of the base module properties and the protection of the inheritor is ensured during their integration, In this way, language support is provided for keeping the behavior of reusable software consistent during its evolution.},

These solutions are based on many years of research and experience in developing systems in one of the most volatile application domains - banking. We discuss why promising software development techniques, such as object-oriented and component-based approaches, on their own, cannot meet the challenges and objectives of software development today, and propose a three-layered architectural approach based on the strict separation between computation, coordination and configuration. We present a set of modelling primitives, design principles and support tools through which such an approach can be put effectively into practice, and discuss how it promotes a more dynamic approach to software evolution. Finally, we make comparisons with related work.}

In this context, separation of concerns allows us to separate parts of the software that exhibit different rates of change or different types of change. This makes it possible to provide better evolution support for those parts that have a higher change rate, or to provide different evolution techniques for different views on the software. Another common way to achieve separation of concerns is by raising the level of abstraction to the level of software architectures, business rules and metamodels. This makes software evolution more manageable. The above ideas emerged as important conclusions of the workshop on Formal Foundations of Software Evolution, which was co-located with the Conference on Software Maintenance and Re-engineering in Lisbon in March 2001. Of the 12 original position papers, five have been selected for revision and inclusion in this special issue of the Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution.}

This paper explores an approach to regularities for object systems which greatly simplifies their implementation, making them more easily employable for taming of the complexities of large scale software.
This approach, which is based on a generalized concept of law-governed architecture (LGA) introduced in this paper, provides system designers and builders with the means for establishing a fairly wide range of useful regularities simply by declaring them formally and explicitly as the law of the system. Once such a law-governed regularity is declared, it is enforced by the environment in which the system is developed.}

But the inherent globality of regularities makes them very hard to implement in traditional methods. We have argued elsewhere that this difficulty can be alleviated by means of law-governed architecture (LGA), under which a system designers can establish a desired regularity (of a certain kind) simply by declaring it formally and explicitly as the law of the system. Once such a law-governed regularity is declared, it is enforced by the environment in which the system is developed.
This paper, which is based on a recently developed environment called Darwin-E, describes the application of LGA to object oriented systems written in the Eiffel language. We introduce here the formalism for specifying laws under Darwin-E, and give a sample of regularities that can be efficiently established by such laws. In particular, we demonstrate how one can establish a kernelized architecture suitable for the construction of critical embedded software, such as the software embedded in an intensive care unit.},

Currently, both techniques co-exist without affecting each other and therefore concrete
software projects either use the one or the other approach. There are some
situations where the result of utilizing the one or the other is approximately the
same. Therefore, it is reasonable to analyze each approach in respect to its underlying
philosophy and its impact on the implementation level and to compare them on
the basis of those observations. This paper discusses the equivalences and differences
between the role concept and aspect-oriented programming and reveals potential
synergies between both approaches.}

This system was originally implemented in Java and restructured with AspectJ. Our main contribution is to show that AspectJ is useful for implementing several persistence and distribution concerns in the application considered, and other similar applications. We have also identified a few drawbacks in the language and suggest some minor modifications that could significantly improve similar implementations. Despite the drawbacks, we argue that the AspectJ implementation is superior to the pure Java implementation. Some of the aspects implemented in our experiment are abstract and constitute a simple aspect framework. The other aspects are application specific but we suggest that different implementations might follow the same aspect pattern. The framework and the pattern allow us to propose architecture-specific guidelines that provide practical advice for both restructuring and implementing certain kinds of persistent and distributed applications with AspectJ.},

Effective separation of such concerns is essential to improve understandability and maintainability of artefacts at the various software development stages. Aspect-oriented software development holds promise for the purpose. However, to date, most of the work in this area has concentrated on the implementation level. While the focus is shifting to earlier development stages such as design, very less work exists on separation of crosscutting concerns during requirements engineering.\par
The goal of this paper is to handle the separation of crosscutting concerns at requirements level using UML. To accomplish this we identify and specify crosscutting concerns in separate modules, so that localization and hence, reusability and maintainability can be promoted. The UML-based aspect-oriented requirements engineering mechanism has a two-fold impact. It makes it possible to identify trade-offs among broadly scoped properties early on in the development cycle hence providing decision support for the stakeholders involved. At the same time, being based on UML, the approach adheres to a de-facto industry standard hence making it suitable for incorporation in existing requirements engineering practices.}

Aspect-Oriented software development provides explicit support for dealing with crosscutting concerns. Using this technique, aspects are placed in separate modules that are then woven together with base classes to form an application. Capturing aspects at the design phase makes their design components more reusable. It also makes automatic code generation possible. The Aspect-Oriented paradigm builds on the existing Object Oriented paradigm by introducing the notion of an aspect as opposed to a core class.\par
The unified modeling language (UML) is a modeling language used for specifying, visualizing, constructing and documenting software systems. One of the strengths of the UML is that it provides extension mechanisms that enable the language to be adapted to different types of systems, domains, and methods and processes. In this paper we propose a UML extension for modeling aspect-oriented OO systems. The proposed extension builds on the work discussed in [11], which aims at shifting the aspect-oriented paradigm from the programming level to the design level. We successfully applied the proposed extension to the Rational Rose  CASE tool package as an add-in, facilitating the use of the proposed extension constructs. The add-in also generates an AspectJ skeleton file for the Rational Rose model designed using the proposed extension.}

    used as the universal technique for modeling object-oriented
    applications across a wide range of domains. Developing a truly

    requirements and activities can be challenging. Recently, many
    adaptations and extensions to UML have been made to reflect a
    domains world view. As a technique, domain-specific UML
    metamodeling has gained in importance, e.g., in the context of code
    generation. However, the support for metamodeling within UML is
    weak and while many CASE tools do support manifold extensions they
    do not offer inherent metamodeling. We propose in this paper a
    pragmatic presentation of how to extend OpenTool/UML using the
    tools built-in metamodeling capabilities to support Aspect Oriented
    Programming (AOP) in UML. Using a full metalanguage, called
    OTScript, we will show how the AOP concepts can be added and
    modified in a fully integrated UML environment, supporting consistent
    viewing at both the semantic model level and the user interface level.},

    author       = {Naomi Sapir and Shmuel Tyszberowicz and Amiram Yehudai},
    abstract = {Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a promising approach for handling concerns in software
    development that crosscut the conventional modular structure of the system. Such concerns are, for
    example, tracing, memory management, fault-tolerance, etc. Aspects are modular units in which
    developers manage the concerns that cut across the other modular units, which are orthogonal to them.
    In this position paper we mainly refer to AspectJ. According to that, aspects are class-like elements in
    which developers encapsulate concerns that cut across classes, the natural unit of modularity in
    OOPLs. Aspects are similar to classes: they have a type, state, and behavior, and they can have fields,
    methods, and types as members.\par
    This position paper deals with two main issues: (1) We propose a methodology for aspect
    development using the UML notation. (2) We introduce ways to constrain the use of aspects using
    Aspect Constraint Language (ACL), an OCL like language. This allows project managers to control
    the development while avoiding undesired effects.\par
    Research on AOP has mainly focused on the implementation phase of software development.
    Furthermore, researchers have not paid much attention to the way aspects themselves are to be
    developed, and have not attempted to separate the aspect development from that of the other parts of
    the system. According to our approach, an aspect is considered as a separate application that crosscuts
    the application under development (AUD), yet must not merge into it, nor change the AUD logic and
    structure, i.e. the aspect has to keep the AUD untouched and consistent. The aspect application has its
    own lifecycle, and a defined process should support aspect development.\par
    Currently, the usage of aspects is uncontrolled, and no limits or constraints are implied during the
    aspect design and implementation phases. Not constraining the usage of aspects, weakens the added
    value of AOP. Instead of simplifying the development process, aspects might cause code tangling in
    various sources, spread functionality, and produce inconsistent and unpredictable behavior throughout
    project lifecycle. Therefore, in order to gain control, there is a need to impose constraints on aspect's
    usage during the analysis and design phases and to enforce the constraints during aspect
    implementation phase.}

We build components by composing features, which define particular services or aspects of the component. The behavior of features is specified individually with partial (or incomplete) diagrams. Using refinement concepts for automata complete component descriptions are created by combining the partial automata of the desired features. In addition to this cross-cutting of components, we also consider feature interactions, which is a well known problem from the telecommunications area. We use adaptors as a glue for combining highly-entangled features which do interact. In this way we show that graphical software modeling with statechart diagrams can be extended to modular composition of features.}

    Join points define the places where two concerns crosscut one

    specify a set of join points at which two concern models are
    (inter)connected to each other. Hence, it is a primary task for
    an aspect-oriented modeling language to provide suitable
    representations for join points. In our Aspect-Oriented Design
    Model we have identified join point representations in the
    UML that serve the needs of aspect-oriented designers of
    aspect-oriented programs written in AspectJ. In this paper we
    evaluate if and to what extent these representations are apt to
    serve as hooks for crosscutting specified with Composition
    Filters, in Adaptive Programming, and in Hyper/J, as well.

Although some general-purpose aspect languages (GPAL) are available in the meantime, no commonly accepted object model has yet been proposed. Consequently a common terminology is still not available what substantially hinders the spread of good and useful concepts. This paper proposes an object model, which represents the foundation of the GPAL Sally. We compare our model in respect to AspectJ which is by far the most popular and well-established aspect language and, therefore used by a wide community.}

Subject-oriented programming represents an approach
to distributed programming in the large and is an
attempt to decentralize development. The technology
utilizes `class composition as opposed to `object
composition in implementations of the delegation
pattern. Class implementers employ classic objectoriented
methodologies while at a higher level
decisions are made as to how classes will be combined
from several different implementations. While it is
easier to form these compositions during initial
development, source availability is not a requirement.
This facilitates the extension of existing applications.
In this paper, we conclude that the subject paradigm is
equal to the process paradigm in most regards and
may offer certain advantages over the object-oriented

Alternative descriptions of the same intentional view can be provided and checked for consistency. In addition, the model supports the declaration, verification and enforcement of relations among intentional views. This facilitates software evolution by providing the ability to detect invalidation of important intentional relationships among concerns when the software is modified.}

 abstract = {With software systems such as operating systems, the interaction of their components becomes more complex. This interaction may limit reusability, adaptability, and make it difficult to validate the design and correctness of the system. As a result, re-engineering of these systems might be inevitable to meet future requirements. There is a general feeling that OOP promotes reuse and expandability by its very nature. This is a misconception as none of these issues is enforced. Rather, a software system must be specifically designed for reuse, expandability, and adaptability [4]. Operating systems are dominated in many aspects. Supporting separation of concerns and aspectual decomposition in the design of operating systems provides a number of benefits such as reusability, expandability, adaptability and reconfigurability. However, such support is difficult to accomplish. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) [7] is a paradigm proposal that aims at separating components and aspects from the early stages of the software life cycle, and combines them together at the implementation phase. Besides, Aspect-Oriented Programming promotes the separation of the different aspects of components in the system into their natural form. However, Aspect-Oriented software engineering can be supported well if there is an operating system, which is built based on an aspect-oriented design. Therefore aspects can be created in applications, reused and adapted from the aspects provided by the operating systems. Object-Oriented Operating Systems treat aspects, components, and layers as a two dimensional models, which is not a good design model. Aspects in the operating system cannot be captured in the design and implementation. Two-dimensional models lead to inflexibility, limit possibilities for reuse and adaptability, and make it hard to understand and modify. The poster will show an Aspect-Oriented Framework [1, 8], which simplifies system design by expressing its design at a higher level of abstraction, for supporting the design of adaptable operating systems. A framework is more than a class hierarchy and it is a reusable to produce custom systems and applications [5]. Aspect-Oriented Framework is based on a three-dimensional design that consists of components, aspects, and layers.}

 abstract = {As the size and requirements of software systems increase, their design has reached a complexity that requires software engineers to revisit the principle of separation of concerns [5]. Traditional software organization has been performed along some form of functional decomposition. Different paradigms and languages support the implementation, and composition of sub-parts into whole systems through the availability of some modular unit of functionality (component). In essence, traditional software decomposition and current programming languages have been mutually supportive [4]. At the same time, separation of concerns can only be beneficial if the different concerns can be effectively composed to produce the overall system. The OOP paradigm seems to work well only if the problem to be solved can be described with relatively simple interfaces among objects. Unfortunately, this is not the case when we move from sequential programming to concurrent programming where the component interaction violates simple object interfaces. One of the reasons behind this is the inherent structure of today's software systems that conceptually does not lead itself to a safe decomposition. As a result, the benefits associated with OOP no longer hold. Component interactions limit reuse and make it difficult to validate the design and correctness of software systems. Reengineering of these systems is needed in order to meet future changes in requirements. This component interaction is based on a number of properties that affect the semantics or the performance of the system and do not localize well in one modular unit, but tend to cut-across groups of components resulting in a code tangling [4]. Example cross-cutting properties (or aspects) include synchronization, scheduling, and fault tolerance. This code tangling destroys modularity, making the source code difficult to develop and difficult to understand. It also limits reuse, making the source code difficult to evolve. It further makes programs more error prone. In essence, it destroys the quality of the software. In [1] the authors refer to these phenomena as composition anomalies. This composition anomaly requires a shift in the methodologies used to separate concerns. In conjunction with modular composition, adaptability and reuse remain major issues to be considered while building complex software systems. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) [4] is an emerging methodology that addresses components and aspects at the analysis and design phase of the software life-cycle, using mechanisms to compose them at the implementation level with a growing number of different technologies.}

 abstract = {The type systems of most object-oriented database systems
             (00DBSs) descend from traditional object-oriented
             programming langunages. While these systems can capture
             many interesting relationships among entities, such as
             classification and subtyping, they do not typically allow
             an object to change type, and they only partially support
             the modelling of objects that have many types. However,
             such characteristics are particularly common among the
             very entities (e. g., people) that these systems are
             intended to model. We introduce aspects, a new mechanism
             designed to meet these modelling requirements within the
             framework of a strongly-typed 00DBS. An aspect extends an
             existing object with new state and new behavior while
             maintaining the same object identity. In addition to the
             modelling of roles, aspects have other interesting
             applications, such as encapsulating the result of a
             query.} }

                complex and many concerns in the implementation of such systems
                are of highly crosscutting nature. The concept of aspect
                orientation can be applied to allow a modular implementation of
                these concerns. With AspectJ the first complete and powerful
                language extension for aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has
                been created. However, the costs of the Java run-time
                environment are not feasible for most embedded applications.This
                paper presents AspectC++ (Gal & Spinczyk 2001), a new language
                extension to C/C++ that provides powerful language elements to
                facilitate aspect-oriented programming even in domains with
                tight resource limitations. }

                 users, yet the associated code bloating and performance loss
                 often render an application unsuitable for some users,
                 particularly those interested in using the application in an
                 embedded system. As a result, developers are often faced with
                 either reinventing pieces of an application, custom tailored to
                 their needs, or they are faced with the daunting task of
                 refactoring an existing application to obtain an appropriate
                 subset of that application's functionality. In either case,
                 subsequent development, maintenance and testing of the
                 application becomes more complex, due to the effects of future
                 revisions on all of the derived subsets.In this paper, we
                 report on our experience in obtaining subsets of an
                 application's functionality, using a relatively new
                 programming-language paradigm and tool to achieve the subsets
                 compositionally. Instead of refactoring a large, feature-rich
                 application, a feature can be added by including that feature's
                 aspect in the set provided to an aspect compiler. In
                 particular, a minimal, base implementation was developed in
                 Java and features were added by supplying the appropriate
                 advice to an AspectJ compiler. We describe our approach and
                 present footprint and performance results for automatically
                 derived subsets of an event channel.} }

    abstract = {Since many applications are too complex to be designed
                in a straightforward way, mechanisms are being
                developed to deal with different concerns
                separately. An interesting case of this separation is
                security. The implementation of security mechanisms
                often interacts or even interferes with the core
                functionality of the application. This results in
                tangled, unmanageable code with a higher risk of
                security bugs. Aspect-oriented programming promises to
                tackle this problem by offering several abstractions
                that help to reason about and specify the concerns one
                at a time. In this paper we make use of this approach
                to introduce security into an application. By means of
                the example of access control, we investigate how well
                the state of the art in aspect-oriented programming
                can deal with separating security concerns from an
                application. We also discuss the benefits and
                drawbacks of this approach, and how it relates to
                similar techniques.}

    abstract = {CORBA is a commercial standard for distributed object computing which shows great promise in the development of distributed programs. Its interface description language (IDL) enables objects to be developed independently of the underlying programming language, operating system, or computer architecture on which they will execute. Programs deployed in a wide-area distributed system encounter conditions which are much more hostile and varying than those operating in a single address space or within a single local area network. In this paper we discuss four major problems we have observed in our developing and deploying wide-area distributed object applications and middleware. First, most programs are developed ignoring the variable wide area conditions. Second, when they do try to handle these conditions, application programmers have great difficulty because they are different from the local objects they are used to dealing with. Third, IDL hides information about the tradeoffs any implementation of an object must make. Fourth, there is presently no way to systematically reuse current technology components which deal with these conditions, so code sharing becomes impractical.\\
In this paper we also describe our architecture, Quality of Service for CORBA Objects (QuO), which we have developed to overcome these limitations and integrate their solution by providing QoS abstractions to CORBA objects. First, it makes these conditions first class entities and integrates knowledge of them over time, space, and source. Second, it reduces their variance by masking. Third, it exposes key design decisions of an objects implementation and how it will be used. Fourth, it supports reuse of various architectural components and automatically generates others.},

  abstract = {Object-oriented technology and design is not the final answer to
  the recurrent problem of making systems, on one hand, more open and flexible
  and, on the other hand, more robust, safe, and fast.   While object-oriented
  languages have a lot of success in implementing components,  they have rather
  limited support for expressing composition abstractions.  As such, the
  component-based software principle is only partially supported by the
  object-oriented approach.   Component-based software development breaks down
  an application into stable parts, i.e., the components, and high-level
  abstractions for composing the components.  Flexibility is provided by the
  possibility to recompose.  How can we design a composition language to
  support this metaphor?  What mechanisms are needed to encapsulate components,
  to make their contextual assumptions explicit, and to define composition
  abstractions in a compact way?  We argue that we should seek the minimal
  kernel of mechanisms that allows us to define composition
  abstractions, instead of adding additional language constructs to
  the object-oriented
  paradigm.  This is necessary in order to reason about these abstractions and
  derive properties of the composed application.   In this thesis we propose
  Forms, Agents and Channels as this minimal set of abstractions.  Forms
  are extensible records unified with services.  They are primitive objects, act
  as explicit namespaces, and encapsulate arguments to invoke services.
  Agents are autonomous entities that exchange forms along channels.  We show
  that this simple model is expressive enough to define high-level composition
  abstractions while being small enough to be mathematically tractable.   We
  present the formal model of forms, agents and channels in terms of a
  composition calculus.   We encode the composition calculus into the
  asynchronous pi-calculus and show the soundness of this encoding.  We
  define the composition language Piccola on top of the composition calculus by
  adding some syntactic sugar and by defining a bridge to access external
  components.  The usefulness of Piccola is demonstrated by defining
  composition abstractions and reasoning about them at the level of the
  language.  We present several kinds of composition abstractions:  wrappers to
  adapt components, connectors to implement composition styles,  and
  coordination abstractions that cross-cut the functional decomposition of a
  system.  We also demonstrate how to reason about composition and how to use
  glue code to detect and fix compositional mismatches.},

    difficult to maintain in the face of changing requirements. The
    complexity of software evolution can, however, be significantly reduced
    if we manage to separate the stable artifacts (the components) from
    their configuration (the scripts). We have proposed a simple, unifying
    framework of forms, agents, and channels for modelling components and
    scripts, and we have developed an experimental composition language,
    called Piccola, based on this framework, that supports the
    specification of applications as flexible compositions of stable
    components. In this paper we show how Piccola can be used to reduce the
    complexity of software evolution through the specification and use of
    an appropriate compositional style, and we illustrate the approach
    through a non-trivial example of mixin layer composition.

affecting a set of collaborating classes is a better unit of reuse than
a single class. Different techniques and language extensions have been
suggested to express such slices in programming languages. We propose
delegation layers, an approach that scales the OO mechanisms for single
objects, such as delegation, late binding, and subtype polymorphism, to
sets of collaborating objects. Technically, delegation layers combine and
generalize delegation and virtual class concepts. Due to their runtime semantics,
delegation layers are more flexible than previous compile time
approaches like mixin layers.}

    abstract =       {Object-oriented languages come with pre-defined
              composition mechansims, such as inheritance,
              object composition, or delegation, each
              characterized by a certain set of composition
              properties, which do not themselves individually
              exist as abstractions at the language
              level. However, often non-standard composition
              semantics is needed, with a mixture of composition
              mechanisms. Such non-standard semantics are
              simulated by complicated architectures that are
              sensitive to requirement changes and cannot easily
              be adapted without invalidating existing
              clients. In this paper, we propose compound
              references, a new abstraction for object
              references, that allows us to provide explicit
              linguistic means for expressing and combining
              individual composition properties on-demand. The
              model is statically typed and allows the
              programmer to express a seamless spectrum of
              composition semantics in the interval between
              object composition and inheritance. The resulting
              programs are better understandable, due to
              explicity expressed design decisions, and less
              sensitive to requirement changes.}

              based on the programming language Lua and on CORBA,
              allows applications to select dynamically the components
              that best suit their requirements, to verify whether the system
              is satisfying these requirements, and to react, when appropriate,
              to variations in the nonfunctional properties of
              the services in use. We use CORBA s Trading Service to
              support dynamic component selection. An extensible monitoring
              facility supports monitoring of dynamically defined
              requirements. We use the Lua language to specify adaptation
              strategies, and a smart proxy mechanism to apply these
              strategies.},

We address these questions for a particular but quite general class of aspects: aspects which can be described as static source-to-source program transformations.\par We discuss the design of a generic framework to express aspects as syntactic transformations as well as a generic weaver. We also consider how to use semantic properties for the definition of aspects and how to implement these properties using static analysis techniques. As an application of the framework, we sketch how to describe and implement an aspect dealing with program robustness and exceptions.},

    url            = {http://aopdcs.enst-bretagne.fr/pang.ps},
    abstract       = {With modern software systems, an important
              requirement is the ability to be auto adaptive,
              i.e. being able to adjust itself to the changing
              environment. In line with this, a run time manager
              for dynamic feature integration of
              telecommunication systems, interaction detection
              and resolution is described in this paper with
              aspects being used to implement features. The
              manager manages the interaction of
              features/aspects by monitoring the managed
              program. The program is represented by a labelled
              transition system (LTS) model, stored in a
              flexible data structure, and executed by calling
              action subroutine represented by the label of the
              LTS model, forming a reflective facility for the
              composition and analysis of features. It is the
              reflective mechanism that makes dynamic feature
              addition, run time model checking, as well as
              adaptive interaction resolution possible. Runtime
              model checking is possible because the checked
              program is stored within itself, and the
              interaction resolution will be done by selecting
              behaviour traces according to the resolution
              rules.},

              software project that can affect multiple
              dispersed implementation entities (functions,
              classes, etc.). In this paper, we examine
              large-scale refinements in terms of a fundamental
              object-oriented technique called
              collaboration-based design. We explain how
              collaborations can be expressed in existing
              programming languages or can be supported with new
              language constructs (which we have implemented as
              extensions to the Java language). We present a
              specific expression of large-scale refinements
              called mixin layers, and demonstrate how it
              overcomes the scalability difficulties that
              plagued prior work. We also show how we used mixin
              layers as the primary implementation technique for
              building an extensible Java compiler, JTS.}

              components of our PLA are layers or ``aspects''
              whose addition or removal simultaneously impacts
              the source code of multiple objects in multiple,
              distributed programs. The complexity of our
              component specifications is substantially reduced
              by using a DSL for defining and refining state
              machines, abstractions that are fundamental to
              simulators. We present preliminary results that

              more flexible way of implementing
              state-machine-based simulators than is possible

    abstract = {Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is intended to ease situations
                that involve many kinds of code tangling. This paper reports on
                a study to investigate AOP's ability to ease tangling related to
                exception detection and handling. We took an existing framework
                written in Java, the JWAM framework, and partially
                reengineered its exception detection and handling aspects using
                AspectJ, an aspect-oriented programming extension to Java.We
                found that AspectJ supported implementations that drastically
                reduced the portion of the code related to exception detection
                and handling. In one scenario, we were able to reduce that code
                by a factor of 4. We also found that, with respect to the
                original implementation in plain Java, AspectJ provided better
                support for different configurations of exceptional behaviors,
                more tolerance for changes in the specifications of exceptional
                behaviors, better support for incremental development, better
                reuse, automatic enforcement of contracts in applications that
                use the framework, and cleaner program texts. We also found some
                weaknesses of AspectJ that should be addressed in the future.}

   abstract = {Aspect-oriented programming, component models, and design patterns are modern and actively evolving techniques for improving the modularization of complex software. In particular, these techniques hold great promise for the development of "systems infrastructure" software, e.g., application servers, middleware, virtual machines, compilers, operating systems, and other software that provides general services for higher-level applications. The developers of infrastructure software are faced with increasing demands from application programmers needing higher-level support for application development. Meeting these demands requires careful use of software modularization techniques, since infrastructural concerns are notoriously hard to modularize.//
Building on the ACP4IS meeting at AOSD 2002, this workshop aims to provide a highly interactive forum for researchers and developers to discuss the application of and relationships between aspects, components, and patterns within modern infrastructure software. The goal is to put aspects, components, and patterns into a common reference frame and to build connections between the software engineering and systems communities.}

    editor = {Omar Aldawud and Mohamed Kand\'e and Grady Booch and Bill Harrison and Dominik Stein},
   abstract = {Many concerns pertaining to software development have a crosscutting impact on a system. Using current technologies, such kinds of concerns are difficult to identify, understand, and modularize at design and implementation time, as they cut across the boundaries of many components of a system. Crosscutting concerns typically include design constraints and features, as well as architectural qualities and system-level properties or behaviors, such as transactions, logging and error recovery, etc.\\
Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) is an emerging technology promoting advanced separation of concerns in software engineering. AOSD techniques allow one to modularize crosscutting concerns into separate "aspects" of a system and integrate those aspects with other kinds of modules throughout the software development lifecycle. Aspect-oriented modeling is a critical part of AOSD that focuses on techniques for identifying, analyzing, managing and representing crosscutting concerns in software design and architecture, while filling the gap between aspect-oriented requirements engineering and aspect-oriented programming.\\
This workshop is dedicated to the definition of aspect-oriented modeling techniques, methods and tools based on UML. Suggested issues are: How can we apply UML artifacts to AOSD? Are the existing notations and modeling techniques of UML sufficient to model aspects, or do we need to extend UML to support AOSD? Is UML the appropriate modeling language on which to base modeling for AOSD? Is UML capable of expressing "Core" components and "Aspectual" components as well as associations linking them together? If we have to extend the UML, are the extension mechanisms provided by UML adequate? What could then be a UML profile for AOSD? Or would it be possible to rely only on a restricted subset of the UML for AOSD? What would this subset be?}
